# ClickerCounter
Records the number of clicks made by a user and saves it to a CSV.

This is a simple mouse click recorder that records and number of left and right clicks made by a user and saves it to a CSV along with the process at that time that was using the most memory.

It is intended to be used as a background system but can be used for one off records by changing the commented code at the bottom to print the number of clicks.
